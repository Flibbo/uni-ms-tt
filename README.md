# University of Münster Typst Template

This is an **unofficial** [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) template for writing a

- [ ] lecture / presentation
- [ ] report
- [ ] bachelor's thesis
- [ ] master's thesis

at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/).

I'll try to align it with the *LaTeX template* of the workgroup [Autonomous Intelligent Systems](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AISystems/) in the department of [Computer Science](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Informatik/) at the faculty for [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.uni-muenster.de/FB10/).
